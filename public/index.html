      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a

    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

                          Camilio was a company whose flagship product was called SmartSite. SmartSite generated marketing websites for businesses. These sites could be created with a few clicks of a button. SmartSite also enabled choosing design, editing content, and adding digital storefront easily.
                          My main job was to build various templates that the site contained and to update the editing system. The designs were prepared by Valeria Abramov. I used CSS, HTML, JSON and internal tools. I worked together with product and R&D departments.
                          Unfortunately, Camilio closed down and now it is impossible to create websites on SmartSite or see my works directly.
